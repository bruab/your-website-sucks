Let’s talk about carousels - those dynamic elements that rotate between multiple images, and sometimes multiple headlines and buttons as well.

To you, they might seem fun and engaging. The truth is: 

- They’re distracting 
- They look like ads
- They’re hard to click on. 
- They’re problematic for people using screen readers* 

For all these reasons, they’re bad for conversion and user experience. This is a well-worn topic among UX and conversion professionals.

But you still have one, don’t you? You might even be putting two on the same page.

{% include carousels.html %}

For the sake of conversions, and your visitors’ eyeballs, please stop.

## Here's how to fix it

Replace your carousel with a single, static element.

Use the combination of message, call to action, and (optional) image that is most relevant to most of your customers.

Put everything else below it. You’re done.

Maybe that’s not an option, because you don’t know which message is most relevant. Or your team can’t agree which message is most relevant.

In this case, test it.

You can use an online service to run a “preference test” - showing multiple options to a qualified panel of participants, and asking them to choose the most compelling.

If your team can’t agree on the single most important message your visitors need to hear … and isn’t willing to let your audience decide for them … well, we tried, didn’t we?

Sucks for you. And your visitors.
