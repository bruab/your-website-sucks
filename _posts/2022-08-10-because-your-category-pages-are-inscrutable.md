title: ... because your category pages are inscrutable
---

On an ecommerce site, navigating from the homepage to a category page is a moment of great excitement.

What wonders await in the aisles of this magnificent store? 

Now that I've decided what _kind_ of thing I'd like to buy, what will the shopkeeper delight me with?

So when I choose "overglaze decals" from a button on the homepage, or a link in the navigation, I'm bursting with anticipation to see an abundance of beautiful, artistic creations.

And you show me this:

A bit deflated, I skip over all this boring stuff and begin to scroll. And I see this:

No doubt these sticker sheets are full of gorgeous detail work and arresting colors. But ... I can't see it. Like, at all.

My next move should be to scroll until I see a design that calls out to me, then to hurriedly tap and explore it in more detail.

But instead I'm forced to _read_ - I have to process product titles into mental images, because I just can't make out the actual images you're showing me.

Here's another one:

I can easily read the titles and prices of these items, because the text takes up more space than the images. But if you asked me to pick one or the other out of a lineup, I couldn't do it.

## Here's how to fix it

Minimize the vertical footprint of your category page hero image, filters, and other elements until _actual products are visible above the fold on mobile_. Give visitors a peek at your wares as soon as the page loads.

And ensure that the product images on your mobile category pages are big enough, and detailed enough, to be worth tapping on.

If you have sufficient traffic, an A/B test of "two products per row vs 1 product per row (on mobile)" is worth running. The ideal solution varies from site to site, and may even vary from category to category on your site.

But if that's too much effort, just eyeball it. 

Can you see what makes each product different as you scroll down the page on a phone? 

If not, find a way to make the images bigger.
