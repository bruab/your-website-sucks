title: ... because your cookie notice is too complicated
---

The cookie notice on your website is annoying. 

But it's nothing personal - I know you're just staying in compliance with the law. And for what it's worth, I find the cookie notice on every website to be annoying.

It _becomes_ personal, though, when your cookie notice somehow becomes a convoluted mini-site in its own right:

The most fundamental rule of website usability is [Don't make me think](https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/).

But for some reason, you're asking me to think about the law, web technology, and my own privacy - all before I've even seen what it is you sell.

There's a good chance I'll just leave without going any further. 

There's a good chance lots of other visitors will do the same. 

And worst of all, you won't even know we were here - because we left the site before your analytics script had a chance to track us.

## Here's how to fix it

_With your legal department's approval_, use the shortest, simplest cookie notice possible. Here's a good example:

![screenshot of a simple cookie notice - "We use cookies to enhance your experience ..." and a button that says "Got it!"](/assets/images/simple-notice.png)

The language is concise and straightforward. The button text is clear and informal. The button itself is large and prominent.

It's easy to scan this, click the button, and move on with life. 

This is what visitors want to do, and what you want them to do. Make it easy!
