# Get a custom micro-audit video

A customized, bite-sized, actionable dose of website strategy in video format.

## How it works

1. You fill out a quick survey about your site
2. I’ll take a look
3. You get a video with 3-5 high impact, low effort suggestions
4. ????
5. Profit

## What it looks like

You’ll get a video with suggestions and rationale.

It’ll contain everything you need to decide whether to act or not, and I’ll be available to supply everything your developer needs to implement the changes if you approve.

Here’s an example:

## "Why should I bother?"

More revenue from the same traffic.

By removing friction, clarifying messaging, and improving usability on your site, you’ll get more leads (or purchases, or signups) from the visitors who are already coming to your site.

## "Who are you to judge my site?"

I’ve been doing Conversion Rate Optimization for years. Worked at top notch agencies like CROmetrics, FunnelEnvy, and Speero. Worked with dozens of brands, like Udemy, General Assembly, L’Oreal, and Eventbrite.

I’ve run hundreds of experiments, and written over a hundred blog posts on the topic. I think about this stuff all day.

I’ll condense everything I know about what visitors expect, what moves the needle, and what doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to implement, then package it up for you 🎁.

## "What does it cost?"

A micro-audit is $100.
