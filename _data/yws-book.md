# Your website sucks


## Here’s how to fix it


# Introduction


## Why you should read this book

The chapters that follow will help you diagnose and fix issues with your website. You’ll find issues that make visitors to your site feel confused, or frustrated, or simply underwhelmed, and you’ll be able to make low risk, high impact improvements to address these issues.

When you do that, you’ll see more visitors convert - whether that means making a purchase, signing up for your software, or filling out a form to talk with your sales team. When more visitors convert, you make more money from the same amount of traffic.

So assuming you _have_ a website, and it’s important to your business (or overall happiness), it’s worth checking to see if you violate any of the principles in this book.

Each chapter outlines how to identify a single common issue. If you find the issue on your site, I’ll tell you how to fix it. (If you find you’re in the clear, pat yourself on the back.)

This book won’t go deep into the technical considerations of implementing updates to a website - the possibilities are too vast and fast-changing to capture in a single document.

It won’t go into specifics about how to use analytics tools to quantify visitor behavior, though there are a few suggestions on how to get started with that.

It doesn’t delve deep into research and theory regarding the behavioral psychology of why people use websites the way they do - we’ll stick with obvious, uncontroversial observations about basic emotions.

The focus is on easily identifying issues that are worth your attention, and fixing them with as little effort as possible.

Work your way through the whole book and you will be the proud proprietor of the rarely-observed Website That Doesn’t Suck.


## Why you should listen to me

Since 2016 I’ve worked in conversion optimization - the marketing practice of using data, research, psychology, and experimentation to measurably improve results on websites.

I’ve worked with brands like Udemy, L’Oreal, and Ghirardelli. Over the course of several years and hundreds of experiments, I’ve gotten a good sense of what stops website visitors from doing what we want them to do.

Controlled experiments frequently lead to surprising insights, but the fact is that most website usability issues are discoverable by just a bit of focused attention and empathy with the visitor.

The challenge is in prioritizing potential issues, and knowing how to fix them. So I wrote this book to help you do just that.


## How to use this book

All chapters follow the same structure: describing a problem, and why it’s a problem, followed by steps you can take to fix it.

There are two main sections: User Experience (UX), and Content. The chapters on UX describe issues with visual layout or behavior of the site, while the second half of the book focuses on the words, images, and videos that make up your site.

The chapters within each section are ordered from “extremely critical” to “worth your attention, but not critical.”

Finally, each chapter is self-contained. So you can read the book front-to-back, compiling a todo list as you go, or you can jump around and read in whatever order suits you.




# Part 1: UX


## Your website sucks because …


# … it's broken

In a perfect world, “make sure your site isn’t broken” would be such a laughably obvious piece of advice that no one would bother putting it in a book.

And yet.

As a guy who gets hired to inspect websites and come up with ways to improve them, I find that about 50% of the time my suggestions start with “fix these broken things.”

Like “this image isn’t loading”:



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


Or “the form is missing”:



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


Or “a link on your site points to a page that doesn’t exist.”

Or “nothing happens when I click this button.”

Or “I literally see an error message on the page.”

All of these issues are easier to fix, and higher priority, than any other advice I could give. But paying a conversion consultant to find them for you is like hiring an electrician to plug in a toaster.


## Here’s how to fix it

First, have some sort of early warning system that will alert you if something’s keeping visitors from converting. Not all errors will prevent conversion entirely, but when this does happen, you need to know about it and address it as quickly as you can.

The system could be some sort of monitoring function built into your analytics, or it could be as simple as “check leads on a daily basis and make sure they’re not at zero.”

It’s also a good idea to track JavaScript errors. Review and address them on a weekly basis until they become infrequent and probably-not-your-fault.

Visually inspect your highest-traffic pages, and any pages that are crucial to conversion (e.g. Checkout, or Contact Us).

Do this in a guest window so you’re not logged in, or cookied, or having your experience modified by a browser extension. 

Repeat the process monthly, and whenever you launch a new sitewide change. “Sitewide changes” include:



* A redesign or theme update
* Adding a new tool (like a chat or popup widget)
* Adding a new element to multiple pages (like a banner or sticky footer)

The correct cadence and degree of scrutiny is something you’ll dial in over time. Just be sure it’s not “never” and “none.” 

And whatever you do, be sure to spot check your site for “obviously broken stuff” before you pay someone to audit it for you.




# … you won't close the deal

I get it, you don’t want to be too pushy, too sales-y.

Your website exists to inform, to build awareness and reputation, not just to sell something.

But … you do sell something, right?

If so, don’t get so caught up in storytelling and education that you neglect to mention it.

Let’s say I’ve heard good things about this product, so I google them and visit their homepage. What can I do here?



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


It’s not exactly obvious what they sell - some kind of platform? But if I want to take action, the only option is to Let Them Help.

So I click that button and visit another page. What can I do here?



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


Not a whole lot. Read, read some more, or Explore Their Platform. Why not try it?



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


Here I can … continue to explore, continue to read, but if I really want to become a customer, I need to Find Out How.

Except “Find Out How” leads me back to the page I came from.

So … what can I do here?


## Here's how to fix it

Have a button that represents a single, relevant, clear next step for visitors who want to become customers. Repeat it throughout your site.

Make it the most prominent button in your header navigation, feature it on your homepage, add it as its own section to other high traffic pages on your site.

As visitors navigate the site and learn about your product, knowing that this is the next step will save them time.

For example, if the next step is “Start Free Trial” they don’t have to learn everything about your product - just enough to decide if they want to try it.

They’re not studying your site for academic purposes - they want to make a decision. A simple, repeated call to action helps them frame the decision and be purposeful in their research.

Give your visitors the gift of this clarity.


# … your forms are too long

Ah, that magical moment.

The moment somebody clicks a button that says Contact Us. (Or Get a Demo, or Start Free Trial, or Subscribe, or Download Report.)

It means they’re willing to trade some personal information for what you’re offering. It means your website works!

So, don’t push your luck.

They _expect_ to see a form after that click. And as long as the form is asking for relevant, reasonable info, they’ll probably fill it out.

On the other hand, imagine they’ve searched for “small business lawyer,” clicked on a result, and they see this:



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


The form doesn’t even fit on the screen. It asks for address, phone number, and email - should they expect a call, a message, and a home visit? Do they _want_ that?

Imagine they decide to download a white paper and they see this form:



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


Is it worth sharing your job title and company revenue to read a white paper? Is it even worth the keystrokes it takes to type that information?


## Here's how to fix it

Consider these two rules of thumb. In general,



* Shorter forms mean more form fills
* You should only ask for information you obviously need

No doubt the sales team wants the name, address, phone number, blood type, and astrological sign of everyone who visits your site. You know, just in case!

But from a visitor’s perspective, it should be clear why you’re asking, and what you’re going to do with the information.

Scheduling a 1-on-1 demo? Company size is probably relevant. Downloading an infographic? Not so much.

Given these rules of thumb, audit every field on every form on your site and ask:

_Do we need this? Is it clear to the visitor why we need this?_

If not, just remove it.


# … you block the user's path

When you added that chat widget, you placed it unassumingly in the bottom right of the user's screen:



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


So when you decided to try out that discount-for-email-opt-in widget, you put it safely in the bottom left:



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


Plenty of space left over for visitors to read your amazing copy, marvel at your striking visuals, click your irresistible buttons.

Except on mobile.

On mobile, your various widgets are scrunched together till they take up 57% of thumb-reachable screen real estate. Which sucks for visitors who don't want to engage with the widgets. Which is most visitors.

There's a slippery slope between "annoying to the users" and "costly to the business."

And that slope gets extra steep where the widgets meet a button or link that's tied to revenue.

Like, say, Add to Bag:



<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")


or Schedule a Demo:



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


Covering up these buttons is like putting yellow police tape around your cash register and asking customers to crawl under it. It's like answering a sales call and saying "oh hey thanks for reaching out, lemme put you on hold for a minute."

Some people will deal with it. It won't drive your revenue all the way down to zero. But it sucks.


## Here's how to fix it

Decide what these widgets are actually worth to your business.

The most rigorous way to find out is an A/B test that removes the widget for 50% of visitors. You might also just try turning it off for a month to see if anything drastic happens.

Then, choose one of the following options according to your comfort level:



* Remove the widgets from the site entirely
* Remove the widgets, but add the corresponding functionality to the navigation
* Remove the widgets on pages where conversions happen
* Remove the widgets on pages where conversions happen, for mobile visitors only
* Minimize the widgets on pages where conversions happen, for mobile visitors only




# … it doesn’t work on mobile

No matter what your business, I assure you that your customers use smartphones.

So if you haven’t updated your styling since 1997, it’s time to hire a web designer so they can make sure that the mobile version is readable on a small screen:



<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")


… and make sure that the elements on the page don’t overlap each other in weird, illegible ways:



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image13.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")


… and that everything fits on the screen: 



<p id="gdcalert14" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image14.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert15">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")


… so nobody has to scroll right to read it all:



<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image15.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert16">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image15.png "image_tooltip")


Other issues you might check for:



* Excessive space between sections
* Links or buttons that are too close together
* Menus that are off-center

But please, just pay an expert to diagnose and fix your mobile issues. Once that’s complete, all you have to do is:



* Add “Review mobile experience” to your checklist for launching site updates
* Check conversion rates by device and by screen resolution every few months to look for underperformers

That’s it! You can now rest assured that nobody will angrily throw their phone into a lake after seeing your website.

And as we all know, “not throwing your phone into a lake” is the first step toward conversion.


# … you leave visitors hanging

With all the effort you spend acquiring and tracking website visitors, you'd think you might give them somewhere to go, no matter which direction they wander. But no.

You entice us with the promise of all-day comfort flex shorts, but when we decide to order a pair in size Medium, you leave us with nothing to click, nowhere to go.

There's no "notify me when it's in stock" or "reserve your pair" or "try this instead." Just existential despair.



<p id="gdcalert16" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image16.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert17">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image16.png "image_tooltip")


Your homepage invites us to read about your company, so we do. Which apparently flatters you so much you're unable to think of where we ought to go next.



<p id="gdcalert17" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image17.gif). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert18">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image17.gif "image_tooltip")


You urge us to watch the cinematic masterpiece that is your Product Overview Video ... okay, fine. But when it ends, we're alone in a darkened theater, awkwardly holding a bag of stale popcorn. And when we close the window, we're staring at the same "Watch Our Video!!!" button we just clicked.



<p id="gdcalert18" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image18.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert19">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image18.png "image_tooltip")



### **Here's how to fix it**

Open your analytics tool and look at a list of pages, ranked from most-visited to least-visited.

Set the date range to the last month or two.

For each of the most-visited pages, open it in your browser and ask yourself, “What do I _want_ visitors to do here?” Then confirm that there’s a clear and logical "here's what to do next" button on the page.

If so, you should feel relieved - maybe even a little smug. If not, add one.

Continue this process - inspecting each page for a clear next step, adding one if necessary. Work down the list until you hit pages with very few views. It won't take long.

When you’re done, you’ll have a website with no dead ends, less confusion, and fewer visitors who exit in frustration.


# … I don’t know what you want me to do

Offer me 10% off and I’m grateful.

Offer me 10% off plus a $30 discount and I appreciate it, but you’re making me do math. Do I want the 10% _before _the $30 or after?

Offer me 10% off, plus a $30 discount, plus a $30 rebate, and now I’m just wondering what you’re up to.

And yet:



<p id="gdcalert19" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image19.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert20">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image19.png "image_tooltip")


It’s true that people love discounts, and that you probably see an increase in sales when you offer one.

But it’s also true that nobody much cares to do math in their heads in order to choose from competing discount options. Especially before they’ve even decided whether they want to buy.

This “pile of promos” model is mostly an ecommerce problem, but SaaS sites put their own spin on it.

Here’s a collection of buttons from the homepage for a data privacy product:



<p id="gdcalert20" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image20.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert21">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image20.png "image_tooltip")


I appreciate the choose-your-own-adventure spirit of this offering, but how am I to know which path makes sense?

If I choose a plan, do I still get a free trial? If I start a free trial, I can always Talk to Sales later … right?

Here’s another button collection:



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image21.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert22">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image21.png "image_tooltip")


What’s the difference between these actions, and how should I choose?

If I get a quote, can I not get a demo as well, and vice versa? And isn’t requesting a demo … a way of contacting you?

This is a problem not just because being unclear or redundant is poor form. The real issue is the very realistic chance that I’ll simply opt to leave your site rather than spend mental energy guessing which button I should click.


## Here's how to fix it

Do the work for your visitors.

Which path should _most_ customers follow? Make that the most prominent action. Others can be secondary - make them smaller, or give them a transparent background so they’re less noticeable. Or make them text links, or even push them to the footer.

Which discount applies to the _majority_ of shoppers? Share that one first, and share the others only in context.

Just because you make the other buttons smaller, or move them to the footer, doesn’t mean nobody will find and use them.

But it does mean that _most_ visitors will take the action that’s appropriate for … most visitors. And nobody will give up and leave because you made them think too hard.

# … it asks for too much, too soon

Seriously, we just met. I don’t know you.

And you’re asking me to tell you where I live, enable notifications, and subscribe to your newsletter … all at once? Before I can even have a look around?



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image22.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert23">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image22.png "image_tooltip")


It’s not gonna happen.

Imagine you enter a physical store and the owner accosts you at the door. He asks for your name, address, and phone number, then tries to sign you up for his customer loyalty program.

You’ll probably leave the store at the first opportunity. Politeness might dictate that you promise to “think about it” and maybe pretend to look at a couple items before making your escape.

There’s no such thing on your website, though. Visitors can (and will) simply close the tab and go elsewhere.


## Here's how to fix it

These popups and intrusions take up valuable screen real estate, so make them pay rent.

Don’t include them on your site unless you’ve measured their value, and decided that the overall impact on revenue justifies how annoying they are.

That could involve running an experiment where you hide the widget for 50% of visitors. But simply turning it off for a month will give you an idea of whether it’s actually crucial to your business.

Of course, it’s possible that you’re not even measuring or monitoring the impact of the widget to begin with. If that’s the case, please choose a default setting of Not Annoying.

That might mean asking to enable notifications only after someone has engaged with your site.

It might mean triggering your newsletter popup _only_ after a visitor has spent 30 seconds on the page.

It might mean not asking visitors to enable location services at all, or at least not until it’s clear why you’re asking.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I am hereby giving you permission to assume that “don’t harass visitors” is the optimal strategy.


# … your form fields are a labyrinthine nightmare

Your site doesn’t make money unless visitors fill out forms.

They come to learn, to compare, to consider, maybe even to admire your content. But sooner or later they have to fill out a form - Checkout, or Contact Us, or Signup.

You know this, so you’ve already ensured that your forms aren’t too long. But even with a short form, where all the info you’re requesting is perfectly reasonable, it’s possible to confuse and alienate your visitors. Let’s talk about labels and placeholder text.

Placeholder text is whatever a visitor sees inside an input field before they start typing. Like “Email address” and “Password” in this form:



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image23.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image23.png "image_tooltip")


As in the above form, you can use placeholder text as labels to indicate what the user is supposed to type into the field. You can also use it to provide whimsical suggestions:



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image24.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert25">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image24.png "image_tooltip")


You shouldn’t do either.

Using placeholder text instead of labels introduces all sorts of usability challenges.

Once a user has started filling out the form, they lose all context as to which field contains what information. If they’ve made a mistake, they can’t easily go back and correct it. What’s wrong with this form submission?



<p id="gdcalert25" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image25.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert26">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image25.png "image_tooltip")


The answer is “the second form field is supposed to contain an email address,” but an equally fair response would be “no clue, how am I supposed to know?”

Even when you have labels, as with the second example, you’re better off leaving out the placeholder text. For one, it adds visual clutter. It’s also hard to read for low sight visitors.

On top of that, our eyes are drawn to empty fields, especially when our immediate term goal is to fill them out. It’s not clear to all users that the placeholder text must be replaced. They may skip these fields entirely - until your angry red validation message corrects them.


## Here's how to fix it

Put labels above form fields. Be sure they’re closer to the field they correspond to than to other fields in the form. Leave out placeholder text.

It might not be as cute or stylish, but it will help visitors fill out the form more quickly, accurately, and easily. Which is what we all want.


# … your navigation is overwhelming

We get it. You have a huge website with lots of pages. Your parents must be so proud.

But here’s a little known internet fact: there’s no law saying your top navigation menu has to contain a link to every single page on your site.

If anything, there’s a rule that says it shouldn’t.

Visitors seek out your navigation because they want to get a sense of what’s available on your site, or because they already know what they’re looking for, and they want to access it.

In either case, the ideal experience is a handful of options, one of which seems like what they’re looking for.

If it requires a click or two to drill down, that’s not a problem - as long as knowing what to click is easy every step of the way.

A giant list of options, on the other hand, does not inspire confidence. Instead, it elicits confusion and overwhelm. It asks the visitor to _work_.



<p id="gdcalert26" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image26.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert27">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image26.png "image_tooltip")


They can scan for the exact word they’re looking for, but there’s no guarantee that a word on the screen will match the word in their head.

So they might have to scan several times, then start over at the top, reading each option, one by one, to decide if it’s relevant to their intention. (This is assuming they even remember what they were looking for after 20 seconds of staring at a screen full of text.)

Some visitors will have the patience for this task. Others will opt out of using the navigation, but continue to look for what they want using search or on-page links.

But plenty of them will stare for a few seconds, shake their heads, and close the tab. Off to pursue less painful endeavors.


## Here's how to fix it

The guiding principle here is “make the next click easy.”

If your top-level navigation has 8+ items, eliminate as many as possible, so it’s easier for visitors to figure out which one to click.

If that means using a dropdown navigation, that’s fine!



<p id="gdcalert27" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image27.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert28">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image27.png "image_tooltip")


But if one of your dropdowns has 8+ items, again: eliminate as many as possible, so it’s easier for visitors to figure out which one to click.

If that means creating category pages, that’s fine!

It might take a few clicks to find the exact page they’re looking for, and that’s not a problem. Nobody minds a few clicks, as long as they feel confident they’re headed in the right direction.


# … it only works for some people

Your site is gorgeous. Looks amazing - to me, anyway.

But how does it look to the visually impaired? Can they even read your headings?

How does it _sound_ to the millions of internet users - visually impaired, learning disabled, or non-native English speakers - who use a screen reader program to speak the contents of the site out loud?

The answer is probably “like a hot mess.” The good news is that a few straightforward fixes can greatly improve your site’s accessibility, and _they’re good for conversion too_.


## Here's how to fix it


### Use alt text

Alt text is a short snippet of text that describes an image. It’s invisible to visitors browsing your site visually, but it’s available to those who can’t see images.

Make alt text concise and descriptive, and make sure anybody with the ability to upload images to your site understands the importance of adding it.


### Simplify your primary navigation

“If you link to it, they will come” … said no one, ever.

You already know that cramming too many links into your header does sighted visitors no favors - it’s an overwhelming number of options.

But it’s even worse for people using screen readers, which will _read the entire navigation_ before getting to the page contents.

So just put your most relevant, most-visited links in the navigation. Kick the rest to the footer.


### Label your form fields

You already know that using placeholder text to label form fields makes it confusing for sighted visitors. What’s worse is that it leaves screen reader users without any context at all.

Just add labels. Put them above the input field.


### Make your copy clear and concise

If a page is full of convoluted, abstruse language, sighted visitors will mostly just ignore the copy altogether. (Not good.)

But visitors using screen readers will have to _listen to it all_. (Even worse.)

They don’t get to enjoy the benefit of your fancy animations and visual effects. Just that overlong, mediocre copy.

Load up your homepage, or top landing page. Try reading it out loud. Or take 15 minutes to install and try out a screen reader.

The parts where you cringe, or start getting bored - those are where you need to make edits.


# … it looks just like everyone else's

I can’t predict what trend will be omnipresent across business websites as you read this, but I guarantee there is one.

At one point, everyone’s site had a series of stock photos - actors dressed like businesspeople, smiling. A close up of a handshake reveals dress shirt and blazer cuffs.

The web went through a “short, looping, silent video on autoplay” phase at one point.

And then there were the flat SaaS people.



<p id="gdcalert28" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image28.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert29">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image28.png "image_tooltip")


Whatever trend you’re seeing on everyone else’s website this quarter, you may be inclined to assume that they’re doing it because it works, and that you should do the same.

The fact is, following trends like this doesn’t help me understand your product, or how it can solve my problems. It doesn’t instill trust, or paint a picture of a desirable outcome. And it certainly doesn’t set you apart from the competition.


## Here's how to fix it

Remind yourself that, unless you have evidence to the contrary, you can’t know that your competitors’ website strategy is working. It’s quite possible _they_ don’t even know if it’s working.

So if you have a stylistic element or feature on your website that’s just there because it’s common in the industry, consider removing it.

It may be possible to measure visitor engagement in order to inform this decision, but it’s okay to trust yourself too. Just ask: does this help visitors make a decision? Does it help set us apart?

Clearly the answer is “no” for generic stock photos and uninspired illustrations. 

Get rid of them. 

Instead, focus on visuals that help visitors make a decision. Show the product in use, add diagrams to help explain important concepts, and paint a picture the outcome that successful users achieve.




# … it won't sit still

Let’s talk about carousels - those dynamic elements that rotate between multiple images, and sometimes multiple headlines and buttons as well.

To you, they might seem fun and engaging. The truth is, they’re distracting, they look like ads, and they’re hard to click on. 

They’re problematic for people using screen readers (an assistive technology that speaks the contents of the screen to visitors).

For all these reasons, they’re bad for conversion and user experience. This is a well-worn topic among UX and conversion professionals.

But you still have one, don’t you? You might even be putting two on the same page.



<p id="gdcalert29" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image29.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert30">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image29.png "image_tooltip")


For the sake of conversions, and your visitors’ eyeballs, please stop.


## Here's how to fix it

Replace your carousel with a single, static element.

Use the combination of message, call to action, and (optional) image that is most relevant to most of your customers.

Put everything else below it. You’re done.

Maybe that’s not an option, because you don’t know which message is most relevant. Or your team can’t agree which message is most relevant.

In this case, test it.

You can use an online service to run a “preference test” - showing multiple options to a qualified panel of participants, and asking them to choose the most compelling.

If your team can’t agree on the single most important message your visitors need to hear … and isn’t willing to let your audience decide for them … well, we tried, didn’t we?

Sucks for you. And your visitors.


# … it's illegible

All the snappy website copy in the world won’t persuade me to buy … if I can’t read it.

Imagine the sense of anticipation I feel as I click a link to visit your site, and how it gives way to consternation when I encounter white text over a light background image.



<p id="gdcalert30" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image30.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert31">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image30.png "image_tooltip")


Consider the pain you put me through when I visit on mobile, only to encounter text so small I have to pinch and zoom to read it.



<p id="gdcalert31" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image31.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert32">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image31.png "image_tooltip")


There’s plenty of ambiguity in the world, but I’m confident that your website makes more money when people can read it.


## Here's how to fix it

Don’t have text with a font size smaller than 16 pixels on mobile. If you find yourself needing to use a smaller font to fit everything in, say less.

And whenever you put text over images, have a designer add a transparent overlay, so the copy stands out:



<p id="gdcalert32" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image32.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert33">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image32.png "image_tooltip")


Or highlight the text box with a high-contrast background color:



<p id="gdcalert33" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image33.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert34">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image33.png "image_tooltip")


These minor design tweaks ensure that the copy images you’ve worked so hard to create don’t negate each other, confusing visitors in the process.

And a less confused visitor is more likely to buy.


# … it doesn't work with adblock

It’s not your fault.

You didn’t turn the internet into a cesspool of scammy clickbait promotions.

You haven’t glutted your website with so many trackers, banners, and ads that people have to join the hundreds of millions of users who employ ad blocking technology.

Someone else did that.

But it’s done, and those adblock users come to your site, and it looks broken to them.



<p id="gdcalert34" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image34.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert35">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image34.png "image_tooltip")


There _is_ a form on this page, but it’s added using a highly popular marketing automation tool, which happens to be on the default block list of a highly popular privacy plugin.

Current estimates indicate that about 10% of internet users are browsing with an ad blocker. Are you okay with 10% of visitors being unable to fill out your form?


## Here's how to fix it

Install an ad blocker or two and visit your site.

Does everything work? Great, crisis averted, see you next chapter.

If anything is missing or broken, though, you’ve got work to do.

At a minimum, provide a fallback experience that visitors see when a privacy tool blocks part of your site. A message like this:

_We use Formy McFormerson™, a trusted third party tool, to manage form submissions._

_It looks like AdBlock or another privacy extension is keeping it from working - please disable any privacy tools and reload the page._

If you read that and think “ugh, I don’t want to put that on my website” … well, I’m with you. Much better to have a site that works for 100% of visitors, on the first try.

This may lead you to reevaluate your tools and plugins, and to open up a few tickets with your dev team. It will cost time and money.

But hiding your forms and other key content from 10% of visitors also costs money.

You know what you have to do.


# … it's slow

Nobody likes to wait.

Specifically, nobody likes to wait when they’re not expecting it.

If you’re at the grocery store, you expect to have a couple people in line in front of you. Not a big deal. But if there are eight people ahead of you, that sucks.

It’s much the same with websites. When you visit one, you expect to see some text, and maybe an image, within a few seconds. You expect to be able to interact with it after a couple more seconds. If you can’t, that sucks.

So if your website locks up for 10, 15, even 20 seconds before it becomes usable, I guarantee people are hitting the back button and moving on to their next distraction.

And the ones who stick around have internalized the notion that your site - and possibly the product behind it - is slow and unreliable.


## Here's how to fix it

First of all, hold yourself to reasonable standards.

You may have read headlines making bold claims like “Just a 100-millisecond delay in load time hurt conversion rates by up to 7%.”

That’s a great headline, probably got lots of clicks. It doesn’t apply to you.

Set a page load time goal based on what your visitors expect.

How fast do your competitors’ sites load? If you’re in the same ballpark, it’s probably fine.

Where are your visitors coming from? If it’s social media, they’re in a distractible state and you need to be quick. If it’s a search engine or a referral from another site, they’ll be more patient.

It’s quite possible that the best strategy is to do nothing. However, you have my blessing to work on page speed optimization if:



* Your site's pretty slow
* You can make it a lot faster
* The improvements you're making are pretty cheap

Forgive the imprecision of those guidelines. I don't think we can come to a universal definition of "fast enough" versus "pretty slow."

I’ll give it a shot, though:



* > 15 seconds Time to Interactive (TTI) is pretty slow
* 10 seconds slower than your slowest-loading competitor is pretty slow
* 5 seconds TTI is fast enough

As for "pretty cheap" - the improvements should take no more than a week for the first round, and then a day or two a quarter afterward.

For most marketing sites, all this advice boils down to "install a speed optimization plugin, compress images, and move on with life."

Let someone else dump tons of money into trying to be the fastest site in the world. As long as you’re not losing visitors in droves, you should settle for “not terrible” and move on.


# … it asks unnecessary questions

Imagine you meet someone new and ask where they’re from.

“Paris,” they reply.

“Oh, cool,” you say. “And what country are you from?”

The conversation isn’t likely to go much further. They’ll think you’re either dumb or trolling.

But you’d never ask the followup question, because there’s obviously no reason to. You know better.

Your website, on the other hand …

Take a look at this checkout screen:



<p id="gdcalert35" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image35.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert36">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image35.png "image_tooltip")


Fun fact, the first digit of a credit card number tells you what type of card it is - 3 for American Express, 4 for Visa, 5 for MasterCard, 6 for Discover.

So there’s no need to ask.

This unnecessary question is annoying to me, and it’s off-putting even to people who _don’t_ spend their free time researching the arcana behind credit card numbers. Because they shop online all the time, and almost no other site asks for this info.

You might introduce similar friction if you have an address autocomplete function - one that asks me to start typing my address, then select the correct one from a dynamically populated dropdown box.

Once I select that address, you’ve got my city, state, and zip code. Please don’t ask me to type them in manually.

When I start filling out your form, it’s because I’m excited to do business with you! But when you make that process slower and more frustrating than it needs to be, my excitement starts to wane, and doubt creeps in. I start to wonder if every interaction with you will be this annoying. Push it too far, and I’ll just close the tab.


## Here's how to fix it

You’ve already made sure that your forms aren’t too long. 

(If you don’t have to ask, don’t ask. If you do have to ask, but _not yet_, ask later.)

Then take another look at every input you require visitors to complete and ask, is there any way to get this information other than making them type it?

If you can derive the answer from something they’ve already told you, just do that.


# … it's trying to impress me

Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.

You _can_ use fancy CSS to cause every element of your page to slide in, slide up, slide down, or spiral onto the screen as you scroll.

I’ll be honest, back in 2009 when I first saw this kind of animation I said “ooh.”

So I understand if you had the same reaction when your website design came in for review, and you saw all those moving pieces.

Since 2009, though, I’ve seen something else. I’ve seen lots of humans using websites, and when humans use websites they like to scroll and scan.

And all those impressive animation effects mean you can scroll, but you can’t scan.



<p id="gdcalert36" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image36.gif). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert37">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image36.gif "image_tooltip")


These effects are all over the internet because they look impressive to the people who pay website designers.

Not because they have any effect on website visitors, beyond slowing them down, frustrating them, or possibly creating the impression that the site is broken.


## Here's how to fix it

Give your homepage one last, lingering, slow scroll. Let out a wistful “ooh.” Then kill the animations.

What you’ll get is a page that feels fast, and facilitates the finding of information. Which is what people came to your website for!


# … it's too consistent

It’s so nice to bring order to chaos.

Each element of your website drawn from a comprehensive design system, ensuring no erratic, out-of-place details to distract from the unity of your vision.

Some websites have a slapped-together, design-by-committee look and feel that distracts, confuses, and undermines trust. Not yours!

Bad news, though: it’s possible to take it too far.

For example: in the quest to provide a consistent experience across all popups on your site, you might find yourself creating something like this:



<p id="gdcalert37" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image37.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert38">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image37.png "image_tooltip")


“Click ‘Cancel’ to cancel cancelling.” At least that’s how I read it - what about you?

“Confirm/Cancel” as default popup options make sense for _most_ actions. Send email? Confirm. Update profile photo? Eh, cancel.

It’s just this one action where things break down.

But if every other popup on the site has the same two buttons, what are you supposed to do -  change this one? Break the consistency of the entire site?

Yes.


## Here's how to fix it

Have a design system, and be consistent. Just be willing to make exceptions.

You don’t have to throw out the harmonious patterns you’ve created. 99% of the time they will be the right answer.

And a regular practice of user testing, session recording analysis, and auditing chat logs for user frustration will point you to the 1% of cases where you need to break with convention.

So: be consistent.

But also: listen to your users. And be willing to break the rules if in order to address their confusion.


# Part 2: Content


## Your website sucks because …


# … I don't even know what you're selling

Every single visitor to your site is a victory, and an opportunity. 

Out of all the queries they might have typed into the search engine, they chose one that points to one of your pages. Out of all the search results, they clicked on yours. 

Amazing.

Even more amazing is when someone comes in with some trust and familiarity already established. Maybe I googled you because a friend mentioned your product favorably. Even more amazing!

Unless what I see upon landing is completely inscrutable.

Unless, after developing an interest in self-hosted alternatives to Google Drive / Dropbox, and talking to a trusted friend who is an expert in the field, and finding out that he uses a thing called “flurb” for file storage, and excitedly typing “flurb” into the search engine and clicking the top result … unless after all that, they see this:



<p id="gdcalert38" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image38.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert39">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image38.png "image_tooltip")


What is Cells? Why should I care about a new data architecture format? “Makes compliance monitoring and reporting easier” - easier than what? What am I looking at?

The fact that there’s no visual representation of the product is a problem we’ll address in a future chapter. But in this case there’s no indication of what the product even _is_.


## Here's how to fix it

Make sure the top section of your homepage clearly communicates what your product is, and what problem it solves.

(For bonus points, you should also convey who it’s for and what makes it different from alternatives.)

Test and improve on this language until it’s as elegant as possible.

If you have an exciting announcement to make, use a narrow banner at the top of the page, or a section further down the page, or maybe an annoying popup. Or even all three.

But remember that (a) nobody is as excited about it as you, and (b) new visitors have to understand what you do before they can celebrate amazing new features.


# … it doesn't tell me what I'm getting

Once upon a time there was a viral video of a teenager trying to trade a “mystery box” for a $6.50 video game at a pawn shop. The shop owner says no - “can’t run a business on a gamble.”

Spoiler alert, there’s $500 in the box.

But the shop owner’s right - it doesn’t make sense to accept an unspecified offer from someone you don’t know.

So as much as I might want to sign up for this champagne delivery box:



<p id="gdcalert39" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image39.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert40">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image39.png "image_tooltip")


… I’m not going to click Add to Cart without knowing the details. “2 wines” - are those cans, boxes, or bottles? Splits or demis? The page doesn’t say.

I might be persuaded to sign up for this playbooks-as-a-service platform:



<p id="gdcalert40" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image40.png).

… but when I click “Try free” here’s what I see:



<p id="gdcalert41" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image41.png).

This product has different plans and pricing tiers - which one am I getting for the 7-day trial? What happens after the trial ends? What’s in the mystery box?


## Here's how to fix it

If you have an ecommerce website, make sure you include thorough product details for everything in your store. Dimensions, volume, weight, quantity, color, materials.

If you have a SaaS product with a free trial, make sure you tell visitors what plan they’re trialing, and what happens after the trial is over.

Either way, consider adding a small, unobtrusive popup to key internal pages on your site. Just ask one question: “What’s missing from this page?”

After a few weeks, if you’ve left out any essential information, some kind hearted soul will take the time to type it into the popup.

There are so many reasons for losing conversions on your website, and lots of them are out of your control. Don’t let “I dunno what yer selling” be one of them.


# … you won't show me the goods

You and I know that you actually have a product. (Or a service. Or both.)

It exists, it solves problems, it’s wonderful. People love it.

But we also know that there are unscrupulous types out there who advertise (and even sell) products that _don’t_ exist, or that fail to live up to expectations.

And the poor souls visiting your website, they don’t know you like I know you. They don’t know how truly scrupulous you are. They’re on constant alert for scams.

The easiest way to show them that you have a real product is to … show them the product. So why don’t you?

It’s embarrassingly common to find SaaS homepages with plenty of weird illustrated people, or stock photos, but no images of the product itself. This despite the fact that people come to these pages for the _sole purpose_ of learning about the product.

This issue is less common in ecommerce, where you’re generally obligated to show at least a single picture of what you’re selling. But from a visitor’s perspective, one grainy photo might as well be nothing.

When you’re secretive about what your product actually looks like, you force visitors to take a leap of faith. Before they engage further with your site, they have to decide “well, okay, this is _probably _real …”

But for every visitor who decides to trust you, how many are just closing the tab and moving on with their lives?


## Here's how to fix it

Feature prominent images of your product on your website. Show people _what they’ll see after becoming customers_.

For SaaS, this typically looks like screenshots. If you’re selling a payment platform, show images of earnings reports and checkout screens.

This imagery will communicate “if you become a customer, you’ll be looking at earnings reports and checkout screens.” But beyond that, it unambiguously says “we have an actual product that works.”

For ecommerce, show products from multiple angles, in context, and on a human model where appropriate. Use high resolution, zoomable images.

If you sell an API, or an intangible service, this gets trickier. It’s not impossible, though.

Ask yourself “what will this website visitor be looking at _after_ they become a customer?”

Is it your smiling face on a Zoom call? A monthly report? Server logs that tell them their request latency has gone down? Slap a photo of _that_ on your website.


# … you won't stop bragging

You know and I know that your product is amazing.

Everyone who tries it loves it. Very intelligent people are talking about it.

It makes sense that you want to communicate this to your website visitors. But is it possible you're being ... a little heavy handed about it?



<p id="gdcalert42" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image42.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert43">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image42.png "image_tooltip")


Here's the thing: Most people coming to your website don't know you, don't necessarily trust you yet.

So when you tell them how smart you are, all they really learn is that you're self-centered. 

It's great that you've developed a broad suite of solutions, won some big name customers, and made the news recently - but the time to bring this up is probably after explaining what you can do for your website visitors:



<p id="gdcalert43" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image43.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert44">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image43.png "image_tooltip")


It's cool you've gotten some press, but is sharing that really more important than ... offering your actual product to the people who came to your website to learn about it?



<p id="gdcalert44" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image44.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert45">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image44.png "image_tooltip")



### **Here's how to fix it**

Think fast: What problem causes people to seek you out in the first place? How does it _feel_ to have that problem? What is life like after you solve it for them?

Talk about this on your homepage.

One of the best headlines I’ve ever seen was from a fitness course and community focused on mobility for middle aged men. 

They have over a hundred hours of courses from instructors with years of experience, but they don’t mention this immediately on their homepage. Instead, they lead with this:

_Don’t die without exploring what your body is truly capable of._

On a slightly less dramatic note, an online marketing platform used this headline:

_Build your brand, sell online - all in one place._

Notice how both examples use words like "you” and “your” - if your website copy uses these words, you're on the right track.

There's no shortcut to convincing people to love your product. You have to get them to try it first.

And the way to get them to try it is to demonstrate that you understand their problems.


# … it's a bamboozle

Not _literally_ - I don’t mean you’re selling my info without my consent (though some people are) or advertising a product that you’ll never deliver (though that happens too).

I’m talking about the way that you promise me something to get me to your site, then fail to keep that promise.

Say I’m searching for an industry veteran to help steer my startup. I search for “hire startup advisor” and see this result:



<p id="gdcalert45" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image45.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert46">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image45.png "image_tooltip")


That seems like just what I need - a vetted consultant who can help me with strategy. Someone who specializes in startups.

Here’s the page I land on:



<p id="gdcalert46" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image46.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert47">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image46.png "image_tooltip")


Sorry, what?

Don’t get me wrong, project managers are _so_ important, but that’s not at all what I searched for, or clicked on.

It’s like I sat down to eat at a restaurant and the server is trying to sell me a boat.


## Here's how to fix it

Make the landing page match the link your visitors clicked.

That’s it.

If you’re doing SEO, make sure your content actually answers people’s questions (don’t just write it to please Google).

If you’re running ads, make sure you don’t buy keywords without having a relevant page to send people to.

If you’re running _a lot_ of ads, too many to track, and you’re really not sure who’s landing where or what they’re doing when they get there, consider that you may be wasting a ton of money.

And complicating your operations unnecessarily.

And bamboozling tons of unwitting visitors.


# … it's cold and unfeeling

People visit your website to find information. To solve a problem.

If they can’t confirm that you’ve got:



* the product they need,
* with the features they need,
* at a price they can afford

… you’ll never sell a thing.

But there’s more to a purchase decision than verifying facts.

They have to stick around long enough to learn all that info, for one thing. And if your site isn’t engaging, if it doesn’t spark curiosity, they won’t.

They have to remember you, too, since they’re almost certainly making multiple visits to your site, and checking out your competition.

Not only that, they have to overcome their resistance to (a) spending money and (b) the friction of filling out yet another form.

Curiosity, interest, and motivation don’t come from bullet points of product features. These are _feelings_, and your site needs to create them out of the suspicion, doubts, and fears with which your visitors arrive.

This is pretty hard! Especially if you avoid the topic of emotions altogether.



<p id="gdcalert47" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image47.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert48">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image47.png "image_tooltip")



## Here's how to fix it

Name the feelings that bring visitors to your website, and the feelings they’re seeking. 

You can do this explicitly - for example, a home security system with a heading that says “Peace of mind for your home.”

The motivating feelings are worry and insecurity, and the desired feeling is … peace of mind.

You can do it indirectly - for example, an analytics tool that promises “no more writing awkward SQL queries, or waiting for someone to do it for you.”

The motivating feeling is frustration, and the desired feeling is autonomy, or confidence.

It feels really nice to have your emotional state acknowledged and validated. People pay therapists hundreds of dollars an hour for this experience. Imagine the results if you provide it for free!


### If you don’t know how your visitors feel

Two things:



1. It’s okay :)
2. Finding out should be your top priority

The best way to figure this out is to talk to happy customers. Here are two questions you can ask:

_If our product went away tomorrow, how would you feel?_

_Take me back to when you first realized you needed a solution for ________. Where were you? What were you feeling?_

This feelings stuff is messy. You won’t get a clear, unambiguous answer. You’ll need to take some chances and make some educated guesses.

You might feel nervous about adding this emotional language to your website. That’s perfectly normal because, again, _this stuff is hard_.

… See what I did there? 

I did my very best to acknowledge the way you might feel upon reading this chapter. Maybe I got it right, maybe not. But hopefully you appreciate the sincere effort.

Try your best, and your visitors will appreciate your effort too.


# … it's for everybody

Imagine you’ve successfully bid your way to the first page of results for this very expensive query:



<p id="gdcalert48" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image48.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert49">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image48.png "image_tooltip")


You’re paying somewhere between $60 and $450 _per click_ on this ad.

Now imagine this is where you take me when I click your ad:



<p id="gdcalert49" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image49.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert50">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image49.png "image_tooltip")


Attorneys helping … _people_?

So you’ve successfully distinguished yourself from insect and robot lawyers. But that’s it.

Despite the very specific information that I communicated by clicking a very targeted, _very expensive_ ad, you’re giving no reassurance that you specialize in - or even particularly care about - my unique situation.

Everybody picks on lawyers, though. How about SaaS companies?

Here’s a list of homepage headings from several marketing automation (aka “bulk email sending”) platforms:



* Empower your Marketing team and engage your audience with automation
* Big, small, in-house or agency, we’ve got your business covered
* Marketing Automation for the Modern Marketer
* From Collecting Data to Connecting, Let the Platform Do The Work - Focus on what matters most to you as a marketer

Assuming you’re still awake, let’s talk about this copy.

We’ve got a strangely-capitalized reference to “your Marketing team” and a mention of “the Modern Marketer,” whatever that means.

There’s an allusion to “what matters most to you as a marketer” without any detail as to what that might be. And there’s just the explicit “big, small, in-house or agency” catchall language - literally attempting to capture every type of marketer on the planet.


### **Here's how to fix it**

Dare to be just _slightly_ different. Seriously, I dare you.

Talk to your happiest customers, find out what they love about your product, and what it is about them that makes you such a great fit.

Then, pluck up your courage and mention this, explicitly, on your website.

Maybe you don’t sell to large enterprises. If not, you have my permission to talk about small businesses, and highlight why they think you’re great.

Enterprise visitors to your site will probably leave, as they should.

But small business visitors will feel seen, instead of feeling generic. Intrigued, instead of bored. Reassured, instead of suspicious.

Who knows? They might even feel like buying from you.


# … it's written for a robot

The most compelling website copy in the world won’t help you if nobody reads it. So you need a strategy for bringing people to your site.

Optimizing your content for search engine discovery is one such strategy, which plenty of businesses employ to great success.

And yet.

And yet, the highest search ranking in the world won’t help you if your copy reads like a pile of machine-generated gibberish.

Like when you use the phrase “foreclosed home” 36 times in a single blog post:



<p id="gdcalert50" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image50.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert51">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image50.png "image_tooltip")


… or when you use the name of a single product 7 times in a single paragraph:



<p id="gdcalert51" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image51.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert52">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image51.png "image_tooltip")



## Here's how to fix it

First, consider whether keyword-optimized SEO content is even a valuable strategy for your site.

There are other ways for people to find your website. Maybe they come via social media, or ads, or searching for it by name. If that’s how visitors find your site, you have my permission to write content for a human audience.

If you do decide to go for an SEO-optimized content strategy, keep in mind that not all SEO practitioners are created equally.

Shop around, and for each expert you talk to, check out the content they’ve created for other clients. Does it make your eyeballs bleed?

There’s a huge difference in quality between what you get from someone who simply ingests keywords and spits out blog posts vs. someone who’s thoughtful about solving your visitors’ problems.

With a bit of diligence, you can end up with content that satisfies robots and humans alike.


# … it's inordinately circumlocutory

In other words, it’s wordy.

I know your website visitors are smart. Possibly the smartest people in the world - after all, they’ve decided to learn more about your amazing product.

But they’re also humans. They’re distracted, hung over, and half-paying-attention to a meeting.

They have ten other tabs open on desktop, and on mobile they’re forever feeling the pull of their favorite social media dopamine fix.

They’re not about to read pages that look like this:



<p id="gdcalert52" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image52.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert53">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image52.png "image_tooltip")


They scan and skim, and if you present them with novel-dense prose, you lose them.


## Here's how to fix it

Zoom out and visually scan your main web pages for the proverbial Wall of Text.

Where you see one, break it up with images, headings, and bullet points.

Next, shorten it. Turn paragraphs into sentences, then turn the sentences into phrases.

You’re done when a five second glance at any section of any page on your site is sufficient to get an accurate idea of what the content is about.


# … it's lying to me

One way to get more people to make a purchase is to provide social proof - evidence that other humans, ideally similar to them, have already made a purchase.

Another tactic is to create a sense of urgency - implying that visitors need to act quickly or they’ll miss out on an opportunity.

Deploying these tactics is often as simple as adding some copy or installing a free widget on your site.

For example, if you’ve built an ecommerce site on any of the popular platforms, you’ll have several options for creating “social proof sales pop ups.” They look like this:



<p id="gdcalert53" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image53.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert54">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image53.png "image_tooltip")


And a few lines of custom code will get you “shopping cart urgency messaging”:



<p id="gdcalert54" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image54.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert55">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image54.png "image_tooltip")


Crucially, you can trigger the sales pop ups even if you’re not getting sales. And you can fire the shopping cart message whether the item is actually scarce or not.

Given that these notifications are based on solid psychological principles of persuasion, and since it’s pretty simple to add them to your site, doesn’t it make sense to try them out and see if they help?

No. Because they’re cheap, dishonest hacks that real humans will see through.


## Here's how to fix it

Do not lie to your customers. Even if it increases sales in the short term, do not lie to your customers.

Do not use these tactics if the information they present is not absolutely true.

Even if it _is_ true, you should probably avoid them - because plenty of other websites use them dishonestly, and your customers won’t necessarily know that you’re one of the good guys.

Here are a couple of ethical - and more persuasive - ways to provide social proof:



* Display customer reviews, ideally including a picture of the reviewer
* Use video:
    * For ecommerce, add unboxing videos from real customers
    * For SaaS or lead generation, create video case studies and testimonials

As for urgency, it’s fine to let visitors know if supplies are limited, or an offer will soon expire.

And it’s fine to experiment with where and how you present this information.

It’s fine to try all sorts of tactics - just keep in mind that so-called Best Practices, or growth hacks, or plugins and add-ons will not provide you with a moral compass.

It’s up to you to decide where to draw the line, and so I beg you: do not lie to your customers.


# … it wants to be a movie

_Video is king, right?_

A 2017 study indicated that people in the US watch nearly 6 hours of video per day.

With all those hungry eyeballs, it seems obvious that you should produce a slick, stylish video explaining why your product and company are so amazing. Give it some jaunty background music and plop it up there at the top of your homepage. Right?

Not so fast.

It pains me to deliver this news, but people do not visit your website with the same goals and mindset they bring to watching reality TV or sports. They’re looking for information, not entertainment.

And even the greatest product explainer video of all time - even if directed by a five-time Oscar winner - will be ignored by the vast majority of visitors.

A video is not searchable the way plain text is. It’s not copy-pasteable. It’s not skimmable. It requires turning the volume up. And most importantly … nobody particularly cares about your cool video, except you and your leadership team.


## Here's how to fix it

If you absolutely must make a video, go ahead. If you’ve already made one, don’t worry - you’re certainly not alone.

Just keep it out of the homepage hero section.

Instead of relying on a video, focus on crafting a heading, subheading, and (optional) visual that convey what problem your product solves, or what amazing outcome it delivers, and for whom.

Put that at the top of your homepage.

If you have videos that answer visitors’ questions, by all means add them to the site. Just put them a little further down on the homepage. Maybe place them deeper in the funnel - on a Product page, or How It Works page. But remember that not everyone wants to watch them, and not everyone can. So make sure the information they contain can easily be found in text form.

Bonus: Looking to get more views of the videos you’ve added elsewhere on your site? Be clear, in the copy that surrounds them, about how they’re helpful - and how long they are. (“See how it works in 30 seconds” is way more inviting than “Watch the video.”)
