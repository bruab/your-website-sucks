> Carousels (or "image sliders" or "slideshows") are a great way to settle _internal_ disputes over which content should go where - just put it all in there! Done!<br /><br />
>
> For _visitors_, though, they're unhelpful. For _conversions_, they tend to be detrimental.<br /><br />
>
> This is because they're distracting, they look like ads, they don't work well with screen readers, and they're hard to click (gotta time it just right).<br /><br />
>
> It might be challenging, but for the sake of your users (and revenue), you should replace your carousel(s) with a single, relevant, static image.
