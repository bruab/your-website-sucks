Here are links to tools, courses, and articles to help you with some of the topics mentioned in **Your Website Sucks**.

## 5 second test

I made a whole course about this and it is FREE, plus it comes with free testing credits on UsabilityHub. Check it out [here](https://gum.co/first-impressions-workshop).

## User testing

A great way to find unexpected points of friction and confusion on your website. It involves creating a *task* for visitors to complete, paying a panel of testers to complete the task while recording their screen (and their thoughts), then reviewing the recordings.

There's some great information on user testing in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fIDPjG-VZ8) with Ben Labay of Speero. I use [PlaybookUX](https://www.playbookux.com/) for user testing.

## Session recordings

Use a tool like [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) (free) or [Mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/) (cheap) to collect data on where visitors click, scroll, and move their mouse - then replay that data as a recording.

For help, check out my free guide, [Session Recordings: How to improve conversions on your website in less than 25 hours a day](https://briandavidhall.com/session-recordings-guide.pdf).

## Polls

Asking visitors about their website experience gets results that are hit or miss - lots of people just ignore those popups. But it's worth a try. Read [this post](https://briandavidhall.com/polls-not-surveys/) for instructions and suggestions.

## Customer interviews

Speaking directly to customers - or people who have the same problem you solve for your customers - is the most powerful research method I know. For a quick guide on how to go about it, I recommend reading [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/).

## Page speed

Use [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool - but also read [this blog post](https://briandavidhall.com/when-should-you-actually-care-about-page-speed/) to put things in perspective.

## A/B testing

This is a vast topic! First, take a quick look at [this video](https://youtu.be/TmFd-Ix2mpc) on the difference between "conversions" and "conversion rate." Then make sure you've got at least 500 conversions a month. Then, either check out the training resources at [CXL](https://cxl.com/) and/or [reach out to me directly](https://briandavidhall.com/contact/) for help.

## Preference testing

This involves creating multiple versions of a page (or image, or offer) and showing it to a panel. They vote on which one they prefer, and explain why - and _hopefully_ you're able to use that data to make a decision.

UsabilityHub is my preferred platform for this research method. See [here](https://briandavidhall.com/affiliate-links/) for details on how to get 20 free test credits, and check out their [guide to preference testing](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/preference-testing) for step by step instructions.
